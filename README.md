  A “denial of service” or DoS attack is used to tie up a website’s resources so that users who need to access the site cannot do so. Many major companies have been the focus of DoS attacks. Because a DoS attack can be easily engineered from nearly any location, finding those responsible can be extremely difficult.  A bit of history: The first DoS attack was done by 13-year-old David Dennis in 1974. Dennis wrote a program using the “external” or “ext” command that forced some computers at a nearby university research lab to power off.
